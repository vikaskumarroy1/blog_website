          Everyday digital interfaces include a rich variety of images,
          visualizations, and other pictures. However, more than anything else,
          they are made of words. Oh so many words. As we equip teams to design
          and code usable, consistent, beautiful interfaces using systems, it's
          essential that words depend on a strong foundation of typography.

            I'll admit, I am not a typography expert. I lack a graphic design
            degree. I'm never the person choosing a font, scaling type, or
            finessing letter spacing. As a result, I've always been reluctant to
            write about typography.

            On the other hand, I am a pattern hunter. Over the years, I've
            contributed to many design systems that set a foundation for
            typography. Each traversed of steps and decisions to set a foundation
            and apply it to an emerging library of interface components. This
            article summarizes those patterns.

            Typography starts by setting a foundation of font families and weights
            along with fallbacks. It then explores how to build hierarchy using
            size, color, additional details like line-height, and layering
            responsiveness. Those models are then applied to components in a
            system's library (like Article and Header) as well as custom
            components made by other teams.
